        <h2 class="orange">The Sunlight Foundation</h2>
          <p>The Sunlight Foundation is a nonpartisan nonprofit <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/25/AR2006042501699.html" target="_blank">founded in 2006</a> that uses the power of the Internet to catalyze greater government openness and transparency. We do so by creating <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/projects/" target="_blank">tools</a>, <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/" target="_blank">open data</a>, <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/" target="_blank">policy recommendations</a>, <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com" target="_blank">journalism</a> and <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opengovgrants" target="_blank">grant opportunities</a> to dramatically expand access to vital government information to create accountability of our public officials. Our vision is to use technology to enable more complete, equitable and effective democratic participation. Our overarching goal is to achieve changes in the law to require real-time, online transparency for all government information, with a special focus on the political money flow and who tries to influence government and how government responds. And, while our scope began with only a focus on the U.S. Congress, we now are defining open government on the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/local/" target="_blank">local</a>, <a href="http://openstates.org" target="_blank">state</a>, <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/federal/" target="_blank">federal</a> and <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/international/" target="_blank">international</a> level.</p>

        <p>LittleSis is a free database detailing the connections between powerful people and organizations.</p>
        <p>We bring transparency to influential social networks by tracking the key relationships of politicians, business leaders, lobbyists, financiers, and their affiliated institutions. We help answer questions such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Who do the wealthiest Americans donate their money to?</li>
            <li>Where did White House officials work before they were appointed?</li>
            <li>Which lobbyists are married to politicians, and who do they lobby for?</li>
          </ul>
          All of this information is public, but scattered. We bring it together in one place. Our data derives from government filings, news articles, and other reputable sources. Some data sets are updated automatically; the rest is filled in by our user community.</p>
